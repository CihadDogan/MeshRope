# MeshRope

Unity meshed rope/cable implementation. Its physics based on project : https://github.com/NoxWings/Cable-Component

I upgraded it with a tube renderer for more realistic look and it can cast shadows now. Also added a couple settings for phsyics. You can just grab the "MeshRope.cs" file or check samples on SampleScene.
