# MeshRope

Meshed rope/cable implementation for Unity (2019.4.21.f1). Its physics based on project : https://github.com/NoxWings/Cable-Component

I upgraded it with a tube renderer for more realistic look and it can cast shadows now. Also added a couple settings for different phsyical behaviour. You can just grab the "MeshRope.cs" file or download the project and check samples on SampleScene.
